Show animation. colored Numbers. 
Deterministic -> manipulate the initial condition to acheive outcome. 
Initial condition: 6 numbers: angular momentum and linear velocity. 
Cell structure, because if you error a little, you should still get the same result, as physics is continuous. 
strategy 1: Find a large cell. 
strategy 2: Cells of the same number. 
Leads to question: can it happen? 
Can adjacent cells be of opposite numbers? 
What is the edge? 
Does standing on edge exists as exact solutions? 
Ring climbs hump rail analogy
vertices that connect three cells? 
Can there be vertices that connect four cells? 
With the power of simulation, we can plot things out. 
We can fast-forward time and run 1 simulation per second. 
Dynamic 1D plotting. Marching and binary searching. Find third color? recursive. 
Show. Y axis is time. The algo successfully avoided abviously boring areas. 
Findings: borders strikes up high; boring areas and crazy areas. 
However, fails to honest policy. Not using it in the future. 
Also, y axis: simulation time before settle down. Think: how can you tell it's settled down? 
Never reaches zero. 10 to the minus sth. Even better: call the end of simulation before settle down. 
We used total energy. 
Border
Border with animation
Now imagine you do a binary search. Show forever.mat
Party: don't you wonder how this looks in 2D? Or even 6D? 
How to optimize? How to trace out the border of a cell without bothering too much about the inside of a cell? 
show cheat
Green dot??? Periodicity??? 
Show repetition. Many cells? Same cell, with ripple surface? 
Compare with honest. 
What's going on? zoom in to see! 
Now I will take you on a tour into this 2D space. 
"Before I zoom it, What do you expect to see? "
