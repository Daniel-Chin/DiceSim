Cell structure on initial condition space
draw a 1D line in the space, take x
draw x - simulation_time graph

Dumped ideas:
    Split simulation and rendering to different machines

2do:
    Use animation instead of 3D scatter (z axis > time axis)
    
    Processing: canon

Deviations from reality:
    1. Rigid body. 
        we will not have basketball spin. 
    2. Perfect ground. 
        Deterministic. 
    3. Super sharp corner
        Does not spin stably.
