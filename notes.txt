Cell structure on initial condition space
draw a 1D line in the space, take x
draw x - simulation_time graph

Dumped ideas:
	Split simulation and rendering to different machines

2do:
	set resolution=0 to find standing dice
	Ground damping: prop to pressure

Deviations from reality:
	1. Rigid body. 
		we will not have basketball spin. 
	2. Perfect ground. 
		Deterministic. 
	3. Mass distribution on the Dice. 
		???

Discussion:
	What does a three-cell-point correspond to?
