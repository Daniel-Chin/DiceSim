Dumped ideas:
    Split simulation and rendering to different machines

2 do for the write up:
    AE_output/micro_party_blues: show for yellow it's less different

Deviations from reality:
    1. Rigid body. 
        we will not have basketball spin. 
    2. Perfect ground. 
        Deterministic. 
    3. Super sharp corner
        Does not spin stably. 

Discussion:
    Show 2D_scatter_T/tiny_island/41
    topologyOfRedSea
    Could have: 
        made base vectors perpendicular. 
        Use animation instead of 3D scatter (z axis > time axis)
    time step sensitivity?
        Really high! 
        might be interesting to think: if timestep -> 1/inf, will the topology be generally the same?

Writeup:
    (Damp + Normal) * mu
