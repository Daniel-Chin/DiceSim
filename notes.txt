Cell structure on initial condition space
draw a 1D line in the space, take x
draw x - simulation_time graph

Dumped ideas:
	Split simulation and rendering to different machines

2do:
	fig2png
	analyze 2D scatter
	find periodicity
	3D scatter with T	< find the right home
	2.5D scatter with T	< find the right home
	
	A stack of animations
	lock in and animate a 3-cell-point

Deviations from reality:
	1. Rigid body. 
		we will not have basketball spin. 
	2. Perfect ground. 
		Deterministic. 
	3. Super sharp corner
		Does not spin stably. 

Discussion:
	What does a three-cell-point correspond to? 
	Ring climbs hill rail analogy
	Set resolution = 0, got forever.mat
	What causes the sin ripple?
