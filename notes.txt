Cell structure on initial condition space
draw a 1D line in the space, take x
draw x - simulation_time graph

Dumped ideas:
    Split simulation and rendering to different machines

2do:
    Use animation instead of 3D scatter (z axis > time axis)
    
    lock in and animate a 3-cell-point
    animate micro party
    animate green_island 5
    animate periodicity

Deviations from reality:
    1. Rigid body. 
        we will not have basketball spin. 
    2. Perfect ground. 
        Deterministic. 
    3. Super sharp corner
        Does not spin stably. 

Discussion:
    What does a three-cell-point correspond to? 
    Ring climbs hill rail analogy
    Set resolution = 0, got forever.mat
    What causes the sin ripple?
